# Vintage Computer Festival Talks

This repository holds material I used and use to prepare talks at Vintage Computer Festivals througout Europe (mostly Germany). There usually is one directory per year. Topics are around the history of supercomputing, related companies and famous computers.

Results are published at http://speakerdeck.com/stiefkind (PDF slide decks only) and via my [stiefkind/talks](https://github.com/stiefkind/talks) repository (links to audio and/or video recordings).

The talks usually are in German. I sometimes prepare an additional English slide deck for international visitors/readers.


## Ideas for upcoming talks

* Development of Cray-2 / Cray-3
* Development of Cray X-MP and Y-MP
* Some words about the CDC 205
* The Adventures of the CDC ETA 10
* What happened to CDC after Seymour Cray left?
* Some words about the CDC STAR-100
* Anything interesting about the IBM STRETCH?
* IBM 360/91 -- the "phantom machine"
* IBM ACS-1 -- early IBM supercomputer research, never finished
